Hi, I'm Keguang Cheng. I come from China.

This is my son, a Call duck named Chuyi. He broke out of his shell on the first day of the Lunar New Year in 2023 and is now three years old. I received him when he was just a fertilized egg, and after 28 days of incubation, he grew into a lively, energetic duck—life is truly amazing.
